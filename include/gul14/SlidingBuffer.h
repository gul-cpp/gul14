/**
 * Determine how a SlidingBuffer handles decreases of its size.
 *
 * When the buffer's capacity decreases below the actual size some elements
 * have to be dropped. The user can choose between two strategies:
 *
 * 1. Keep the elements with the lower indices (\b `ShrinkBehavior::keep_front_elements`)
 * 2. Keep the elements with the higher indices (\b `ShrinkBehavior::keep_back_elements`)
 *
 * Usually the more recent data shall be preserved, while older data can be
 * dropped.
 *
 * * If SlidingBuffer::push_front() has been used to fill the buffer the front
 *   elements should then be kept.
 * * If SlidingBuffer::push_back() was the fill method the back elements are
 *   usually better to keep.
 * * If a mixture of SlidingBuffer::push_front() and SlidingBuffer::push_back()
 *   has been used this is hard to decide.
 *
 * The behavior is utilized by SlidingBuffer::resize(), SlidingBuffer::reserve(),
 * SlidingBufferExposed::resize(), and SlidingBufferExposed::reserve().

/**
 * A circular data buffer of (semi-)fixed capacity to which elements can be added at the
 * front or at the back.
 *
 * A SlidingBuffer is a flat array containing zero to capacity() elements of an arbitrary
 * type. The capacity can either be specified at compile time via a template parameter or
 * at runtime via resize(). In the former case, the internal buffer is embedded in the
 * object (std::array), in the latter case it is dynamically allocated (std::vector).
 *
 * The SlidingBuffer shares many characteristics with traditional ring buffers: It has a
 * fixed maximum size and new elements are added with push_front() or push_back(). If this
 * is done when the buffer is filled() to capacity, an element automatically drops out
 * at the other end of the sliding window:
 *
 * \code
 * SlidingBuffer<int, 2> buf; // Create a buffer with up to 2 entries
 *
 * buf.push_back(1);
 * buf.push_back(2);
 * buf.push_back(3);
 *
 * std::cout << buf[0] << ", " << buf[1] << "\n";
 * // prints "2, 3"
 *
 * buf.push_front(1);
 * std::cout << buf[0] << ", " << buf[1] << "\n";
 * // prints "1, 2"
 * \endcode
 *
 * This buffer is not intended for producer-consumer problems. If the elements access is
 * atomic it is thread-safe though. All auxiliary functions that mutate the data are not
 * thread safe.
 *
 * Differing from arrays this buffer will start empty (with a size of zero).
 * Once the buffer has grown to its designated size (i.e. capacity), its size() only changes if
 * clear(), pop_front(), or pop_back() are used.
 *
 * A typical application would be to analyze an incoming stream of elements in a finite
 * impulse response filter.
 *
 * This container uses an accompanying iterator class called SlidingBufferIterator.
 * See SlidingBufferExposed for a variant with a different (more performant) iterator
 * interface.
 *
 * Iterator invalidation is specified at SlidingBufferIterator.
 *
 * \code
 * Member types:
 *   value_type                  Type of the elements
 *   container_type              Type of the underlying container (i.e. std::array<value_type, ..>)
 *   size_type                   Unsigned integer type (usually std::size_t)
 *   difference_type             Signed integer type (usually std::ptrdiff_t)
 *   reference                   value_type&
 *   const_reference             value_type const&
 *   pointer                     value_type*
 *   const_pointer               value_type const*
 *   iterator                    SlidingBufferIterator
 *   const_iterator              SlidingBufferIterator const
 *   reverse_iterator            SlidingBufferIterator
 *   const_reverse_iterator      SlidingBufferIterator const
 *
 * Member functions:
 *     SlidingBuffer     Constructor
 *   Element access:
 *     push_back         Insert an element at the back of the buffer
 *     push_front        Insert an element at the front of the buffer
 *     operator[]        Access element by index, unchecked
 *     at                Access element by index with bounds checking
 *     front             Access the foremost element (i.e. [0])
 *     back              Access the last element (i.e. [size() - 1])
 *   Iterators:
 *     begin, cbegin     Return an iterator to the first element of the container
 *     end, cend         Return an iterator to the element following the last element of the container
 *     rbegin, crbegin   Return an iterator to the first element of the reversed container
 *     rend, crend       Return an iterator to the element following the last element of the reversed container
 *   Capacity:
 *     size              Return number of used elements
 *     capacity          Return maximum number of elements
 *     filled            Check whether the buffer is completely filled
 *     empty             Check whether the buffer is empty
 *     resize            Change the maximum number of elements (only if fixed_size==0)
 *     reserve           Change the maximum number of elements (only if fixed_size==0)
 *   Modifiers:
 *     clear             Empty the buffer
 *     pop_back          Drop the last element
 *     pop_front         Drop the foremost element
 *
 * Non-member functions:
 *   operator<<          Dump the raw data of the buffer to an ostream
 * \endcode
 *
 * The sliding buffer can be instantiated in two slightly different versions:
 * * If the size is known at compile time, it can be specified as the \b `fixed_capacity`
 *   template parameter. The elements are stored within the sliding buffer as in a
 *   std::array.
 * * If a flexible capacity is desired, \b `fixed_capacity` can be omitted. It defaults to
 *   zero, and space for elements can subsequently be allocated dynamically as in a
 *   std::vector. You need to use a constructor that sets a certain capacity or set the
 *   capacity afterwards with resize(). As long as the capacity is zero, the buffer is
 *   unusable and most operations result in undefined behavior.
 *
 * \b `ElementT` must be default constructible.
 *
 * \tparam ElementT       Type of elements in the buffer
 * \tparam fixed_capacity Maximum number of elements in the buffer (capacity), zero if
 *                        unspecified/dynamic
 * \tparam Container      Type of the underlying container, usually not specified
