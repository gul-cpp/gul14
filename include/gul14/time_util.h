/**
 * Return the elapsed time in seconds (or a different unit) since the given time point.
 * This function is intended to be used with the sister function tic() to measure elapsed
 * time. toc() is a function template that returns the elapsed seconds as a double value
 * by default; by specifying a different \c chrono type as a template parameter, it can
 * also return other time units and other types.
 *
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * \code
 * auto t0 = tic();
 *
 * // <do some work>
 *
 * // Default: Return seconds as a double
 * std::cout << "Elapsed time: " << toc(t0) << " seconds.\n";
 *
 * // Custom type: Return milliseconds as an integer
 * std::cout << "Elapsed time: " << toc<std::chrono::milliseconds>(t0) << " milliseconds.\n";
 * \endcode
 *
 * \tparam TimeUnitType  The type to be used for calculating the elapsed time since t0.
 *     By default, this is std::chrono::duration<double>, which means that the elapsed
 *     time is returned as a double that represents seconds.
 *
 * \param t0  A time point in the past that should be taken with tic().
 * \returns the elapsed time in the units and base representation of TimeUnitType. By
 *     default, this is a double that represents elapsed seconds. For a TimeUnitType of
 *     std::chrono::milliseconds, it would be an integer representing elapsed
 *     milliseconds.

 * \see tic()

 * Sleep for at least the given time span, with the option of being woken up from another

 * object.
 *
 * Calling sleep() may lead to a context switch of the operation system. Under heavy load
 * or resource contention, this can produce a delay that is longer than expected.
 *
 * \param duration   Time span to wait, as a std::chrono::duration type.
 * \param trg        Reference to a SleepInterrupt object that can be used to interrupt
 *                   the delay. If such an interruption occurs, false is returned.
