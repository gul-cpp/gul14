/**
 * FinalAction allows us to execute something if the FinalAction object leaves the scope.
 *
 * A FinalAction can be used to add RAII like behavior for non RAII object or to do
 * timing measurements.
 *
 * To generate this object you can use the function \ref finally, that leverages
 * template argument deduction of the action's type. This simplifies instantiation a lot.
 *
 * (Implementation is quite similar to what's in the Guideline-Support-Library.)
 *
 * A good example is function call duration measurement. The FinalAction just needs to
 * be created in the beginning of a function and no hassle with diverse possible return
 * points.
 * \code
 * #include <cstdlib>
 * #include <ctime>
 * #include <gul14/gul.h>
 *
 * using gul14::finally;
 * using gul14::sleep;
 * using gul14::tic;
 * using gul14::toc;
 *
 * void foo() {
 *     auto _ = finally([start = tic()] {
 *         std::cerr << "Function foo() took " << toc(start) << " s.\n";
 *     });
 *
 *     std::srand(std::time(nullptr));
 *     if (std::rand() % 2) {
 *         std::cout << "Premature exit\n";
 *         return;
 *     }
 *     sleep(10); // do important stuff (like sleeping)
 *     std::cout << "Normal exit\n";
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * A (bad; use containers instead) example is allocation with RAII:
 * \code
 * #include <new>
 * #include <string>
 * #include <gul14/gul.h>
 *
 * using gul14::finally;
 *
 * std::string bar(float some_float) {
 *     char* buffer = new char[100];
 *     if (buffer == nullptr)
 *         return;
 *     auto _ = finally([&] { delete[] buffer; buffer = nullptr; });
 *
 *     // do stuff that might throw here
 *
 *     snprintf(buffer, 100, "%.1f", some_float);
 *     return { buffer };
 *     // get rid of buffer automagically
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \tparam F The type of the closure/function to be called.
 *
 * \since GUL version 1.1
