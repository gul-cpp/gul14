 *
 * \section introduction Introduction
 *
 * The General Utility Library for C++14 (GUL14) contains often-used utility functions and
 * types that form the foundation for other libraries and programs. The main fields
 * covered by the library are:
 *
 *  - \ref string_utilities
 *  - \ref concurrency_utilities
 *  - \ref date_time_utilities
 *  - \ref statistics_utilities
 *  - \ref debugging_utilities
 *  - \ref numeric_utilities
 *  - \ref container_utilities
 *  - \ref GSL_utilities
 *  - \ref type_traits
 *  - \ref standard_library_backports
 *  - \ref unit_tests
 *
 * To keep the library useful for as many users as possible, special-purpose code has no
 * place in it. Specifically, the library includes:
 *
 *  - Only code that is potentially useful for a wide range of C++ projects
 *  - No external dependencies except for the C++ and C standard libraries
 *
 * We strive for a very high quality level. To ensure this, we follow a list of
 * \ref quality_standards.
 *
 * \section who_is_using_the_library Who Is Using GUL14?
 *
 * GUL14 was developed at the German national particle accelerator laboratory
 * <a href="https://www.desy.de">DESY</a>. It was originally meant to provide a modern and
 * well-tested foundation for the <a href="https://doocs.desy.de/">DOOCS</a> control
 * system which drives most of the lab's accelerators. It is still used mainly in this
 * role, but has since spread to many unrelated projects as well. At some point we decided
 * to publish it on GitHub to make collaboration outside the lab easier.
 *
 * \section usage Usage
 *
 * To use the library:
 *
 *  - Include the main header file \ref gul14/gul.h (or read more under
 *    \ref how_to_include_gul_headers).
 *  - Link your code against the library (-lgul14).
 *  - If you are on Windows, see \ref using_gul_on_windows.
 *
 * All functions and classes are enclosed in the namespace \ref gul14.
 *
 * GUL14 requires at least C++14. It works fine with newer versions of the standard, but
 * uses its own backport types (e.g. gul14::string_view) in function interfaces.
 *
 * \section installation Installation
 *
 * If you are using the [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) package manager, you can install the
 * library simply by running:
 * \verbatim vcpkg install gul14\endverbatim
 * Otherwise, you may have to build and install it manually. Have a look at the
 * [readme file on GitHub](https://github.com/gul-cpp/gul14/blob/main/README.md).
 *
 * \section source_code Obtaining the Source Code
 *
 * You can browse or clone the source code at https://github.com/gul-cpp/gul14.git.
 *
 * \section contributing Contributing
 *
 * Bug reports and feature requests are always welcome and highly appreciated. So are pull
 * requests, but they should fit into the scope of the library – it may be better to
 * discuss new features in a GitHub issue before diving into the implementation.

/**
 * \page how_to_include_gul_headers How to Include GUL14 Headers
 *
 * All header files of the library reside under `gul14/` with no further subdirectories.
 * To get access to almost all of GUL14's functionality, it is sufficient to include the
 * all-in-one header:
 * \code
 * #include <gul14/gul.h>
 * \endcode
 *
 * Two specific header files are not included by this all-in-one header:
 * <ul>
 * <li>`gul14/catch.h`: The header file for the Catch2 unit test framework</li>
 * <li>`gul14/date.h`: Howard Hinnant's header for calendar date functionality</li>
 * </ul>
 * While the unit test framework is simply not useful for inclusion into regular code,
 * `date.h` is excluded chiefly because of its negative impact on compile times. Just
 * include it directly where needed.
 *
 * If you prefer to shave the last seconds off your build times, you are of course free to
 * include also the other GUL14 headers individually without going through `gul.h`. Just
 * follow the documentation of the classes and functions you use to find the associated
 * header files.
 *
 * We do not guarantee that individual header file names will never change (except for
 * `gul14/gul.h`), but we can assure you that this will happen rarely, if ever.

 * GUL can be built on Windows with the Meson build system and the Microsoft Visual C++
 * compiler. Please refer to README.md in our
 * [source code repository](https://stash.desy.de/projects/GUL/repos/libgul/browse/) for
 * details. By default, both a static and a dynamic library (a DLL) are built.
 *
 * Because of the way DLLs work in Windows, the GUL header files must differentiate
 * between a statically and a dynamically linked library. GUL does this by means of a
 * preprocessor macro, `GUL_USING_STATIC_LIB_OR_OBJECTS`. We assume that most users will
 * prefer the DLL version, therefore we treat this as the default case:
 *
 * - If you link your code against the DLL, there is no need to take any further action.
 *   The header files already provide the necessary import declarations.
 * - If you link your code against the static library (or directly against GUL's object
 *   files), you must define the macro GUL_USING_STATIC_LIB_OR_OBJECTS. This will
 *   suppress the DLL import declarations.
 *
 * On other platforms and compilers, the macro is meaningless.
